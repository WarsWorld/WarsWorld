# node is installed globally, but different projects often require different versions.
# Because some devs need to frequently change node versions,
# tools like "nvm" and "fnm" make it easier by detecting files
# like ".node-version" or ".nvmrc".
#
# If you don't need to use different node versions for different projects,
# you can ignore this file and just install node normally.
