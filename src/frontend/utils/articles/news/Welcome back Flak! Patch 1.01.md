# Unit-Specific Changes

## Flak:

- The base luck stat for Flak's units has been adjusted.

  - **Old:** Flak's units had an unusually high base luck stat, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
  - **New:** Flak's units now have a balanced base luck stat, reducing the influence of luck on their performance.

- Flak's Super CO Power, "Luck of the Draw," has been modified.

  - **Old:** "Luck of the Draw" granted Flak's units a random bonus to their attack and defense.
  - **New:** "Luck of the Draw" now provides a consistent and controlled bonus to Flak's units, ensuring more predictable results.

- Flak's CO Zone Power, "Fortune's Favor," has been adjusted.

  - **Old:** "Fortune's Favor" gave Flak's units a significant boost to their luck, further amplifying their unpredictable nature.
  - **New:** "Fortune's Favor" now provides a moderate, balanced increase to luck for Flak's units, maintaining their distinct playstyle without excessive randomness.

- Overall balance adjustments have been made to Flak's units, ensuring they are competitive and fair in the Global League. These changes aim to promote strategic decision-making and minimize the impact of luck on gameplay.

We hope these changes will bring Flak back into the Global League as a viable and enjoyable CO. Happy commanding!

# Tier 4 CO Ranking in the Global League:

Flak, with the implementation of these balance changes, has been reevaluated and positioned as a Tier 4 CO in the Global League. This ranking reflects the CO's overall performance, strategic flexibility, and competitive viability within the metagame.

- Tier 4 COs are strong contenders in the Global League, offering unique playstyles and strategies that can be effective when utilized by skilled commanders.
- Flak's revised mechanics and adjusted abilities now provide a more balanced and fair gameplay experience, allowing players to rely more on their strategic prowess rather than luck alone.
- As a Tier 4 CO, Flak is considered a competitive choice for commanders seeking a challenge and a distinct playstyle. Skillful management of units, positioning, and CO Power usage will be key to achieving success with Flak on the battlefield.

We believe these changes will elevate Flak's position within the Global League, making him a viable and exciting option for players who enjoy a strategic and dynamic playstyle. Happy commanding!
