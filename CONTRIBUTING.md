# Contributing

Before anything else, thanks for considering contributing to Wars World. It's thanks to people like you that the Advance Wars (AW) community can grow and continue to enjoy this beautiful game. Also, by contributing, we don't mean you have to feel obligated to fully commit to the project. We have a philosophy where open source devs are free to come and go as they please. Whether you just want to implement/incorporate your move planner feature to Wars World or become part of the Wars World team, we welcome you!

## Where do I go from here?

You can either look up what needs to be done in our [issues](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/issues) tab or check out our [project boards](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/projects) to pick up something you'd like to work on.

If you've noticed a bug or have a new feature request, [make an issue for it](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/issues/new). It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork and/or create a branch

If the issue/feature you chose is something you think you can fix, then fork WarsWorld and create a branch with a descriptive name so you can start working on it.

If you are an inner collaborator and already part of the Wars World team, you can just make a new branch directly inside WarsWorld.

In either case, a good branch name would be descriptive of what you plan to work on. For example, if it's an update to the mobile navbar, you could name the new branch mobile-navbar-update.

## Setting up your local environment

Setup instructions can be found in our README.md!

## Linting
Our CI/CD process will use a "linter" to check if your code is formatted in a readable way. However, it is up to you to actually fix any formatting issues.
You can check for any problems by running `npm run lint`, and you can fix those problems manually or by running `npm run lint:fix`.
Alternatively, if you are using VSCode, you should install the extension `rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint`
so that your code is automatically formatted every time you save a file.


## RoadMap / Vision

Currently, the project intends to recreate AWBW but with 2023 technology. That means we want to have a live league that works smoothly, a hot from the oven UI/UX that's responsive and streamlines games, being able to look at multiple games at the same time, having a much faster website/not having lag, and many more!

However, AWBW has a lot of parts to it, so we've decide to limit our scope to just delivering a live league queue at this time. We want to avoid direct competition with AWBW as much as we could and create one gamemode and a single queue. This would be a good scope for the project to start out from. Later on we can add new gamemodes such as async, fog, custom CO/skills, etc.

We do not have plans for remaking AW or making our own game/version of it. We want to stay close to what AWBW has accomplished because this project is made by AWBW players that want to play the game with features that can be readily achieved with a more modern tech stack.

## Contact Information

Currently we do not have a Slack/Zulip chat (but we do have a private Discord server!), so if you want to contact the lead of the project, you can send a DM to femboy#6116 and they'll add you.
