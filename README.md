# Wars World

Wars World is an open source project made by AWBW players that want to recreate [Advance Wars By Web/AWBW](https://awbw.amarriner.com/), on a modern tech stack so we can all enjoy playing the game we love on a streamlined, blazingly fast, venue that keeps all the stuff we love plus new desperately needed features!

This repository contains the backend and frontend code and is based on this [starter template](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-websockets-starter).

## Interested in contributing/helping?

# Setting up your local environment

To make sure our project is able to run locally, follow these 6 easy steps!

1 - Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and run it (the Docker daemon is needed to run your local database, so all need is to have the app running in the background. Nothing else!).

2 - Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and the version is recent. version ^18.15.0 is recommended

3 - Clone the repository in your own working environment or IDE.

4 - Copy the "env.example" to ".env" and setup a random password/string in the PGPASSWORD and NEXTAUTH_SECRET fields.

5 - Install the dependencies from package.json and run app using the following code:

```
npm install
npm run db:up // creates DB container
npm run prisma:push // creates tables and columns
npm run prisma:seed // inserts some data to create development users and a match
npm run dev
```

Now go to localhost:3000 and you should be set! If you are having issues, feel free to contact someone in the team!

# My local setup isn't working!

If you are having troubleshotting issues, here are some clear steps to help you get back on track.

1 - Make sure Docker Desktop is running on the background.

2 - Run the `npm i` to install any missing dependencies.

3 - Run `npm run db:destroy` to clear the docker container (and therefore the database as well).

4 - Run `npm run db:up`, `npm run prisma:push`, `npm run prisma:seed` to re-create the docker container and seed the database. You might see the error

5 - Make sure node, npm, git, and docker desktop are all installed properly. Also make sure you copy the ".env.example" file to ".env" and setup a random password/string in the PGPASSWORD and NEXTAUTH_SECRET fields.

# Where is the database? How can we see it?

To see the contents of the db all you need to is run `prisma studio` or `npm run prisma:studio`, this should immediatly send you to localhost:5555 and show you the database!

## How to use accounts and login to WarsWorld as a dev

The following steps are optional, and it's only useful if you want to help with authentication/authorization or you just want to try to login with Discord, GitHub or Google. You also don't need to set up every provider, if you just want to try to login with discord, just follow the directions to setup discord authentication, same with the others. Furthermore you can still login and register users with email and password authentication without following the next steps.

Directions for Github Account:

1 - Open Github, click your icon, and choose `settings`

2 - Scroll down the options on the left panel and click `Developer Settings`

3 - It will bring you to a new page, again on the left click `OAuth Apps`

4 - Click `New OAuth App`

5 - Fill in an Application Name, set the Homepage to `http://localhost:3000`

6 - Set the Authorization Callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`

7 - Click Register application and open the app

8 - You're given your Github Client ID, copy that and add to your `.env`

9 - On the Github page, click `Generate a new client secret`

10 - Copy this and paste it into `.env` as your Github Client Secret. All Done!
