# Wars World

Wars World is an open source project made by AWBW players that want to recreate [Advance Wars By Web/AWBW](https://awbw.amarriner.com/), on a modern tech stack so we can all enjoy playing the game we love on a streamlined, blazingly fast, venue that keeps all the stuff we love plus new desperately needed features!

This repository contains the backend and frontend code and is based on this [starter template](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-websockets-starter).

## Interested in contributing/helping?

Here are our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) where you can learn more about how you can help the project out!

# Setting up your local environment

To make sure our project is able to run locally, follow these 6 easy steps!

1 - Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and run it (the Docker daemon is needed to run your local database, so all need is to have the app running in the background. Nothing else!).

2 - Make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and the version is recent. version ^18.15.0 is recommended

3 - Clone the repository in your own working environment or IDE.

4 - Copy the "env.example" to ".env" and setup a random password/string in the PGPASSWORD and NEXTAUTH_SECRET fields.

5 - Install the dependencies from package.json and run app using the following code:

```
npm install
npm run initialise // only run this once! Everytime it runs, it re-seeds the database.
npm run dev
```

If you see `` Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `localhost`:`5932`  ``, just re-run `npm run initialise`

Now go to localhost:3000 and you should be set! If you are having issues, feel free to contact someone in the team!

# My local setup isn't working!

If you are having troubleshotting issues, here are some clear steps to help you get back on track.

1 - Make sure Docker Desktop is running on the background.

2 - Run the `npm i` to install any missing dependencies.

3 - Run `npm run db:destroy` to clear the docker container (and therefore the database as well).

4 - Run `npm initialise` to re-create the docker container and seed the database. You might see the error
`` Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `localhost`:`5932`  ``
Ignore it, just re-run npm initialise.

5 - Make sure node, npm, git, and docker desktop are all installed properly. Also make sure you copy the "env.example" file to ".env" and setup a random password/string in the PGPASSWORD and NEXTAUTH_SECRET fields.

# Where is the database? How can we see it?

To see the contents of the db all you need to is run `prisma studio` or `npm run prisma:studio`, this should immediatly send you to localhost:5555 and show you the database!

If you can't see it, it might be due to your Docker Desktop not working/not being initialised correctly (npm run initialise).
