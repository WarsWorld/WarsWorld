# Wars World

Wars World is an open source project made by AWBW players that want to recreate [Advance Wars By Web/AWBW](https://awbw.amarriner.com/), on a modern tech stack so we can all enjoy playing the game we love on a streamlined, blazingly fast, venue that keeps all the stuff we love plus new desperately needed features!

This repository contains the backend and frontend code and is based on this [starter template](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-websockets-starter).

## Interested in contributing/helping?

Here are our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/WarsWorld/WarsWorld/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) where you can learn more about how you can help the project out!

If you want to reach out the dev team/ask some questions, feel free to DM femboy#6116 on Discord (we aren't big enough to need our own Discord server yet...)

## Setting up your local environment

Running our project locally just takes 5 easy steps!

1 - Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and run it/the docker daemon (needed to run your local db, you just need to have the app running in the background, nothing else!)

2 - Make sure you have [pnpm installed](https://pnpm.io/) (its like npm but faster).

3 - Clone the repository in your own IDE.

4 - Copy the "env.example" to ".env" and setup a random password/string in the PGPASSWORD and NEXTAUTH_SECRET fields.

5 - Install dependencies and run app (run code below)

```
pnpm i  //This is basically an npm i/install
pnpm dx //This is our npm start
```

Now go to localhost:3000 and you should be set! If you are having issues, feel free to contact someone in the team!

` Soon there will be a more newb/extensive setup your local environment guide here!`
